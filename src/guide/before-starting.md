# Before You Start

Discord Trivia requires basic knowledge of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs) and [Discord.JS](https://discordjs.guide/). This guide assumes that you have a Discord client with working commands. If you need to setup a Discord client with Discord.JS, click [here](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) for an in-depth guide on how to get started then come back here once you're ready.

Furthermore, the latest stable versions of both NodeJS and Discord.JS are recommended.
